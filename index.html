                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Antoine, and my passion lies in computer science. Currently enrolled as a student in Industrial Computing at HELHa, I am deeply intrigued by emerging technologies and their potential to 
assist people. When contributing to a company, I derive satisfaction from knowing that I am making a meaningful impact on both my colleagues and society. I aspire to be part of humanity's progress towards a decarbonized world, where sustainability takes precedence in any project I undertake.
</p>

                    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming, networking, microcontrollers, and 
automation. This portfolio serves as a testament to my educational and professional path, showcasing my 
accomplishments, projects, and expertise.</p>

                    <p>A bit about me: I am a 24-year-old student who still resides with my parents and brother. Growing up in a 
scientific family has fostered a scientific and open-minded spirit within me.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to engage in several multidisciplinary projects that 
significantly enhanced my learning experience. These projects enabled me to acquire skills in diverse areas 
such as programming, web languages, proficiency in microcontrollers, and project management.
</p>

                        <p>One of the most stimulating aspects of these projects was the diverse set of skills required. Programming 
played a central role, pushing me to address intricate problem-solving scenarios and design innovative solutions. The incorporation of microcontrollers in these projects added a practical and tangible dimension, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world applications through the utilization of sensors and 
actuators.
                        </p>

                        <p>Moreover, project management emerged as a crucial cross-cutting skill that I refined during these experiences. Coordinating team members, assigning tasks, meeting deadlines, and managing resources were responsibilities that contributed to sharpening my organizational skills and enhancing my ability to work effectively within a team</p>

                                <p class="mb-4">In the first year of the bachelor's degree, for the multidisciplinary project, we had to create a set of two 
dice with two parts: an electronic part and a computer program. Two parts were linked by a 
communication card. There were six of us in the group, each with a task to perform. The project ran 
throughout the second quarter.</p>
<p></p>In this project, I was responsible for the electronics. I created the electronic schematic and analysed each 
component that was relevant to our project. I also contributed significantly to the report and presentation. I particularly enjoyed working on the electronic aspect, as it aligns well with my skills. I was pleased 
to take on this part of the project where my expertise lies. Other team members focused on the programming aspect, which is an area where I have less proficiency.

                                <p class="mb-4">In 2023, the students studying for a 
                                    second bachelor's degree in industrial IT
                                    had to make a project for the 
                                    multidisciplinary project course. The idea 
                                    of the project was to detect different 
                                    shapes placed on bricks that were 
                                    moving along a conveyor belt.</p>

                                <p>This project included four disciplines: 
                                        technical English for the presentation, 
                                        embedded systems for the sensor, 
                                        database to stock the data, and web 2 to 
                                        display all the data.</p>

                                <p>To carry out the project, we had to use 
                                    an Arduino which contained a source 
                                    code for object detection. Various sensors were used to make this possible: an IR (Infrared) obstacle 
                                    sensor and a camera equipped with AI (artificial intelligence). Every sensor was plugged into the 
                                    Arduino. A Raspberry was used to host a website, a database, and a software called Nodered which 
                                    enabled Raspberry and Arduino to communicate with each other.
                                    </p>

                                <p>We worked in a team for this project and I was with Loic and Steven. We already did the first-year 
project together, so this project was not the first time we worked together. Thanks to that, we knew 
how to work together.</p>
                                <p>I learned a lot of different skills during the making of this project. I have improved my ability to work 
in a group. I’m now pretty good at making websites and databases. It was my main weakness
regarding the project before making it.</p>

presenting a unique and stimulating challenge. My first project involves contributing to the launch of a B2C
initiative by optimizing the configuration of GPS devices tailored for this market. I will play a crucial role in 
developing software that facilitates the connection between our information system and that of our partner, 
aiming to automate the creation of customer accounts. The preferred programming language for this

Polynesian public administration, strategically selecting telecommunication equipment to optimize this 
service. Lastly, in the scope of the third project, my responsibility will be to enhance an existing system by 
identifying suitable telecommunication equipment to replace the waste bin tracking system on collection 
trucks for multiple municipalities. I will be tasked with identifying, testing, and deploying a solution capable 
of identifying bins and measuring their weight, effectively replacing the outdated and inefficient previous 
system. These diverse projects represent an exciting opportunity to apply my technical skills and contribute 
significantly to innovative telecommunication initiatives.

group projects, I've led teams for four years as a head coordinator in the Scouts. In that role, I successfully 
handled a bunch of events, from dinners and barbecues to scout camps. These experiences have polished 
my organizational skills and how I handle people.</p>
                                
                                    <p>'m open-minded and love diving into conversations on various topics—I'm naturally curious. My strong analytical and problem-solving skills, paired with a systematic approach, help me tackle challenges effectively. 
I'm resourceful, not afraid to speak my mind, and have a good deal of empathy. Also, my reserved nature 
reflects my tendency to think things through.

very straightforward and direct, which can make me seem a bit cold in certain situations. I speak my mind 
without sugarcoating, and sometimes it unintentionally hurts people, though that's never my intention.
</p>
                                <p>Like everyone, there are times when I need to be alone and not bothered. During those moments, I'm not 
great at group work and not too sociable. But don't worry, this mood swing is rare. It usually happens when 
I'm tired, making my mood a bit unpredictable.

trays as they passed on a conveyor belt for eight hours straight.</p>
                                
                                    <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked in a nursing home, responsible for scanning people's COVID Safe tickets upon
                                    entry and ensuring their validity. While these first three jobs were temporary and no longer part of my current
                                    portfolio, the subsequent roles are ongoing.</p>
                                
                                    <p>One of my current roles involves providing private math tutoring to high school students, ranging from the third to
                                    the fifth grade. It's my preferred student job—I get to teach what I love, do it from the comfort of my home, and
                                    earn the highest hourly wage. The main challenge lies in establishing oneself as a tutor and attracting clients.</p>
                                
                                    <p>I also work at Actions, where my responsibilities span from handling the cash register to restocking shelves. While
                                    the pay is good, the work atmosphere leaves much to be desired. The manager treats us as if we are incapable, and
                                    any mistake is met with threats of termination.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Additionally, I contribute to the marketing team at Lutosa, assisting with various events whenever they need
                                    support. The tasks are diverse, and the atmosphere is genuinely positive.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Furthermore, I am involved in a creperie during outdoor markets. My duties include preparing orders, setting up
                                    equipment, making crepes on-site, and managing the cash register. Although unpaid—my mother being the boss—it
                                    provides valuable insights into organization and customer relations.</p>
                                
                                    <p> This range of experiences has shaped my adaptability and skills, making me well-suited to handle diverse challenges
                                    in a professional setting.

                                <p class="mb-4">During my school years, I started off learning in my hometown, which set the stage for my love of learning. 
Later, in secondary school, I attended Saint Stanislas School in Mons. A big turning point came when I spent 
a year in the United States, in Missouri. This experience not only improved my English but also taught me a 
lot through sports, boosting my resilience and team spirit.</p>

                                    <p>When I came back, I faced a challenge during the entrance exam for civil engineering. Instead of giving up, I 
decided to switch gears and pursue industrial engineering. After two years, though, I realized that my commitment didn't align with my goals</p>

                                    <p>This led me to reflect deeply on my academic path. In search of something that matched my interests and 
skills, I found my passion for industrial computing. Now, in my final year of the program in Charleroi, I believe this choice is a crucial step in my career. While I don't plan to dedicate my whole life to computing, I 
see this stage as a chance to gain versatile skills and expand my professional horizons.</p>

                                    <p>My journey shows my adaptability and determination to overcome challenges. I'm ready for new adventures.</p>
